# rtl8723bu
Driver for Realtek RTL8723BU Wireless Adapter with Hardware ID `0bda:b720`

# How to use?
## Concurrent or Non-Concurrent Mode
By default driver support the hardware as a station AND as an access point *simultaneously*.  This will show two devices when you run the `iwconfig` command.

If you do not want two devices (station and an access point) *simultaneously*, then follow these instructions.

- Step 1: Run the following command in the Linux terminal. 
```
nano Makefile
```

- Step 2: Find the line that contains `EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_CONCURRENT_MODE` and insert a `#` symbol at the beginning of that line. This comments that line and disables concurrent mode.


## Manual install
Run the following commands in the Linux terminal.

```
sudo make
sudo modprobe -v 8723bu
```
This driver can not work with the standard driver rtl8xxxu, thus you need to blacklist it. Run the following command
...
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/50-rtl8xxxu.conf
...
Add a single line: blacklist rtl8xxxu
...
## Automatic install using DKMS
If you don't want to worry about building/installing driver after kernel update, use this scenario. For Ubuntu/Debian install DKMS package using command `sudo apt install dkms`.

Then run following commands in terminal
```
source dkms.conf
sudo mkdir /usr/src/$PACKAGE_NAME-$PACKAGE_VERSION
sudo cp -r core hal include os_dep platform dkms.conf Makefile rtl8723b_fw.bin /usr/src/$PACKAGE_NAME-$PACKAGE_VERSION
sudo dkms add $PACKAGE_NAME/$PACKAGE_VERSION
sudo dkms autoinstall $PACKAGE_NAME/$PACKAGE_VERSION
```
